Tag â€” Flutter frontend prototype

This folder contains a minimal Flutter app skeleton created to replace the earlier Expo scaffold.

Run locally:

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. From a terminal:

```powershell
cd app_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- This is a starting point. Camera recording, video upload and AI verification are placeholders to implement next.
- If you want hot-redeploy for real-time testing, ensure Flutter DevTools and appropriate device/emulator are configured.
